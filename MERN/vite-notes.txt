First attempt at creating a Vite/React app: 

cd vite-practice

npm create vite@latest client --template react

Told it to proceed

Select a framework: 

I chose Vanilla, but next time look for React maybe?

Select a variant:

I chose JavaScript

Done. Now run:

cd client

npm install

npm run dev

This made the localhost:5173 show a Vite + JavaScript sign appear. (It should've been Vite + React)

It had counter.js and main.js.


SECOND ATTEMPT:

Select a framework: 

scroll down and press Enter on React

Now it is Vite + React on the localhost
