== compares the values after performing type conversion if necessary
=== compares the values without performing type conversion

Integers:
In order to loop through a number, you need to change it into a string.   num.toString()


JS Methods:

reduce() iterates over an array & accumalates a single a single value based on a provided function

... is the spread operator & collects all the arguments passed to the function into an array
- This allows the function to handle any number of arguments, making it more flexible
- You can then iterate over the array (that the ... created) to preform operations on the arguments.

Example of the Spread Operator: 
function sum(...numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let number of numbers) {
        total += number;
    }
    return total;
}

console.log(sum(4,5,6,7)) // output: 22
